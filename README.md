## Search

The application supports searching across multiple selected tables.

Current search modes:

- Name
- Relationship

---

## Security

Table names are validated before use.

The backend prevents invalid SQL table names by:

- validating identifiers
- rejecting SQL keywords
- using parameterized queries wherever applicable

## Future Ideas

- Tags
- Birthday support
- vCard import/export
- Duplicate detection
- Full-text search
- Dark mode
- Automatic backups
- Encrypted database
- Google Contacts API synchronization
